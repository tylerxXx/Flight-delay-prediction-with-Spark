# Flight-delay-prediction-with-Spark
Use machine learning models with Spark to predict flight delays.

I trained a **LogisticRegression** model with a **Pipleline** preparing the data, a **CrossValidator** to tune the parameters of the model, and a **BinaryClassificationEvaluator** to evaluate our trained model.
